### *Vertcoin* - VTC

**Why this coin isn't with the other privacy coins?**: 

Basically a Litecoin fork. The only mention of a privacy feature is specifically in the wallet with stealth addresses from Coin Market Cap. I don't see any details on the website. It looks like this has been 51% attacked frequently. The only thing remotely interesting is one-click mining, and that's a stretch. This project looks like some bags.

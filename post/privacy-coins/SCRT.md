## *Secret* - SCRT

**Market Cap**: ~$207 million

**Privacy**:  -  

**Transaction Stats**: ? block time **/** ? transactions per second **/** ? fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> Secret Network is the first blockchain with privacy-preserving smart contracts. Applications built on Secret Network utilize encrypted data without exposing it to anyone, even the nodes in the network. Secret Network empowers developers to build decentralized, permissionless, privacy-preserving applications - Secret Apps. For blockchain technology to reach global adoption, users and organizations need granular control over their data. Private by default - transparent when needed - Secret Network's programmable privacy delivers this level of control, securing and scaling Web 3.0.

**My Impression**: 

Seems like less of a currency, and more of a 'computational gas' for secret smart contracts. It used to be an ETH token, but has it's own blockchain now. Seems like a niche use case, but also a necessary one.

*How do I feel about this project?* Neutral üòê

## *Super Zero Protocol* - SERO

**Market Cap**: ~$36 million

**Privacy**: Full - Super-ZK 

**Transaction Stats**: undefined block time **/** undefined transactions per second **/** undefined fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> SERO describes itself as a privacy protection platform for Decentralized Applications. It aims to become a next-generation privacy blockchain that supports smart contract and enables the issuance of privacy coins and anonymous assets. SERO platform reportedly allows developers to issue privacy coins and use them in DApps. SERO claims to have built the world's fastest zero-knowledge proof encryption library "Super-ZK" which is reportedly 20+ times faster than the latest zk-SNARKs (Sapling upgrade) that Zcash uses. SERO also claims to be the first privacy coin protocol supporting smart contracts using zero-knowledge proofs.

**My Impression**: 

Like ETH, if the tokens used a quicker zk-SNARKs (Super-ZK) implementation. I can't tell if the coin itself has its transactions protected by Super-ZK, and if it's Opt-In or not. It's also unclear if it requires a trusted setup, which to my knowledge, a zk-SNARK implementation does. Without knowing those details, this coin is a hard pass for me.

*Overall impression*: Unsure / DYOR ðŸ˜•

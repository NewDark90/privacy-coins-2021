**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> MWC is an in-progress implementation of the MimbleWimble protocol. Many characteristics are still undefined but the following constitutes the first set of choices: Clean and minimal implementation, and aiming to stay as such. Follows the Mimblewimble protocol, which provides hidden amounts and scaling advantages. Cuckoo Cycle proof of work in two variants named Cuckaroo (ASIC-resistant) and Cuckatoo (ASIC-targeted). Relatively fast block time: one minute. Fixed block reward over time with a decreasing dilution. Transaction fees are based on the number of Outputs created/destroyed and total transaction size. Smooth curve for difficulty adjustments.

**My Impression**: 

The first MimbleWimble-based coin on the list is, well, MimbleWimbleCoin. It's my least favorite of the three. Half of this coin was pre-mined and distributed to BTC holders that signed up for a few airdrops in 2019 and 2020. The trading volume of this coin is also very low. Overall, this project seems sketchy. There doesn't seem to be anything about this coin that BEAM or GRIN does better on some level. My hunch says this one will fade.

*How do I feel about this project?* Wary 😕

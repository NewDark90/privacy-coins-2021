**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> Verus Coin is a zero-knowledge technology, privacy-oriented project working to offer Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS). Verus Coin introduces a new consensus algorithm called Proof of Power, a 50% PoW / 50% PoS algorithm, which aims to solve weaknesses in other PoS systems. The Verus Coin‚Äôs project vision is to enable automatic blockchain provisioning with PBaaS, provisioned by Verus miners, and stakers. Verus claims to be a 100% fairly launched community project, with no-ICO and premine.

**My Impression**: 

I'm not going to pretend I'm smart enough to know wheather or not this concept overall is a good idea. I just can't find a good reason to advocate for this coin over others in this list.

*Overall impression*: Neutral üòê

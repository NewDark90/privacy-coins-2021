## *Firo* - FIRO

**Market Cap**: ~$92 million

**Privacy**: Full - Lelantus, Dandelion++ 

**Transaction Stats**: 5 min block time **/** ~14? transactions per second **/** ~0.0005 Firo fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> Firo (formerly ZCoin) is a digital currency that enables untraceable private transactions, offering users freedom from large financial institutions. The team behind the project believes that privacy is a human right and that people need the option to regain control over their money. Firo uses zero-knowledge proofs in order to maintain anonymity. The technology allows users to prove to their counterparties that they own the Firo coins they are sending without actually revealing the source of the coins. When a coin is minted, it is destroyed soon after. When this occurs, the Zerocoin protocol generates a random serial number and a secret number. These are used in a cryptographic function to generate a value that a user becomes committed to. The value is then posted on the blockchain in order to prevent it from being changed again in the future.

**My Impression**: 

Seems like the privacy-first tech used here is stronger than RingCT & CryptoNote, while not requiring a trusted setup unlike zk-SNARKs. The "burn and mint" strategy is novel and kind of cool. It's a pretty straight-forward coin without a lot of the other bells and whistles. It's early for Lelantus so it's not as battle tested, which is a concern.

*Overall impression*: Good ðŸ˜ƒ

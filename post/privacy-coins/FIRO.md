## *Firo* - FIRO

**Market Cap**: ~$92 million

**Privacy**: Full - Lelantus, Dandelion++ 

**Transaction Stats**: 5 min block time **/** ? transactions per second **/** none? fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> Firo (formerly ZCoin) is a digital currency that enables untraceable private transactions, offering users freedom from large financial institutions. The team behind the project believes that privacy is a human right and that people need the option to regain control over their money. Firo uses zero-knowledge proofs in order to maintain anonymity. The technology allows users to prove to their counterparties that they own the Firo coins they are sending without actually revealing the source of the coins. When a coin is minted, it is destroyed soon after. When this occurs, the Zerocoin protocol generates a random serial number and a secret number. These are used in a cryptographic function to generate a value that a user becomes committed to. The value is then posted on the blockchain in order to prevent it from being changed again in the future.

**My Impression**: 

Seems like the privacy-first tech is stronger than Monero. The "burn and mint" strategy is novel and kind of cool. It's a pretty straight-forward coin without a lot of the other bells and whistles of other coins (smart contracts, atomic swaps, etc). A quick fix from the devs against a 51% attack is a good sign that this coin has a future. It's not a terribly exciting project, but it seems strong and I want to see where it goes.

*How do I feel about this project?* Good ðŸ™‚

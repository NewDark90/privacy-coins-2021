## *Pirate Chain* - ARRR

**Market Cap**: ~$64 million

**Privacy**: Full - zk-SNARKs, Tor 

**Transaction Stats**: 1 min block time **/** <=34 transactions per second **/** 0.0001 ARRR fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> Pirate Chain harnesses Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) from Komodo, zero-knowledge proof (zk-SNARKs) transactions from ZCash, and the rule of enforced private-only transactions by Monero. Whereas many other ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù coins have optional privacy features, Pirate (ARRR) claims to be a 100% private send cryptocurrency, as well as the first 'z transaction-only' chain. ZK-Snarks technology (zero-knowledge cryptography) is utilized to shield peer to peer transactions. The team claims that this has created the largest shielded private pool of funds of any privacy coin.

**My Impression**: 

What if ZCash only had z-addresses? That's Pirate Chain. If I had ZCash, it'd make me want to convert it to ARRR out of principle. This coin is probably my favorite that uses a zk-SNARKs implementation. With so few coins having privacy features as the default or only way to transact, it's a nice change of pace. The branding might be rough for any kind of mass public adoption, however.

*How do I feel about this project?* Great üòÑ

## *Oxen* - OXEN

**Market Cap**: ~$58 million

**Privacy**: Full - RingCT, CryptoNote 

**Transaction Stats**: 2 min block time **/**  transactions per second **/** ? fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> LOKI rebranded to Oxen. Oxen is a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency that joins a long list of other coins that are trying to improve on Bitcoin‚Äôs lack of privacy. Oxen is a developer platform for privacy tools. Through the usage of Oxen‚Äôs technology stack, developers are able to access proper privacy, security, safety and decentralization. As such, this privacy network allows users to build applications on the Oxen platform which include messaging services, and even online marketplaces or social media platforms that are privacy-oriented. By default, all of them will have a high level of data security and privacy that are fundamentally risked each time a user signs up for a traditional platform.

**My Impression**: 

Seems like the project is more of a set of developer building blocks for private blockchain-based applications. I like the concept, but will the developers come?

*Overall impression*: Neutral üòê

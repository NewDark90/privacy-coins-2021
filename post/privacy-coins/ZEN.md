## *Horizen* - ZEN

**Market Cap**: ~$563 million

**Privacy**: Opt-In - zk-SNARKs 

**Transaction Stats**: 2.5 min block time **/** undefined transactions per second **/** ? fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> Horizen uses a sidechain architecture that can open up a myriad of potential real-world use cases. This cross-chain transfer protocol allows for decentralized sidechains. These are separate blockchains that are pegged to the parent blockchain that can run simultaneously.

**My Impression**: 

Opt-In zk-SNARKs implementation... wait, is this ZCash? No? Ok. Blockchains on blockchains? Sounds cool, but I don't know what to make of it. Hard to dig up details on this one.

*How do I feel about this project?* Neutral 😐

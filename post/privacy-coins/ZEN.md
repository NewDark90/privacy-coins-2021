## *Horizen* - ZEN

**Market Cap**: ~$563 million

**Privacy**: Opt-In - zk-SNARKs 

**Transaction Stats**: 2.5 min block time **/** ? transactions per second **/** ? fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> Horizen uses a sidechain architecture that can open up a myriad of potential real-world use cases. This cross-chain transfer protocol allows for decentralized sidechains. These are separate blockchains that are pegged to the parent blockchain that can run simultaneously.

**My Impression**: 

Opt-In zk-SNARKs, but with [blockchains on your blockchain?](https://i.imgur.com/m8DNm5i.jpg) Sounds cool, but I don't know if that's a good enough reason to use it over others.

*Overall impression*: OK ðŸ™‚

## *Dero* - DERO

**Market Cap**: ~$23 million

**Privacy**: Full - CryptoNote, RingCT, Bulletproofs 

**Transaction Stats**: 27 sec block time **/** 1000 transactions per second **/** ? fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> Dero is the first crypto project to combine a Proof of Work blockchain with a DAG block structure and wholly anonymous transactions. The fully distributed ledger processes transactions with a twelve-second average block time and is secure against majority hashrate attacks. Dero will be the first CryptoNote blockchain to have smart contracts on its native chain without any extra layers or secondary blockchains.

**My Impression**: 

Seems OK. 10% Premine. Nothing amazing jumping out at me, but nothing horribly offensive either. Big shrug here.

*How do I feel about this project?* Neutral üòê

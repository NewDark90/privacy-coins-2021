## *CUTcoin* - CUT

**Market Cap**: ~$25 million

**Privacy**: Full - RingCT, CryptoNote 

**Transaction Stats**: 2 min block time **/** ? transactions per second **/** ? fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> CUTcoin describes itself as the first CryptoNote-based pure PoS coin. The CUTcoin uses cryptography to enable anonymous transactions. Its Proof of Stake consensus conceals the total amount of coins in staking wallets. The project is the first to have developed privacy tokens (CNT) on it's chain. The tokens deployed on the Cutcoin chain has all privacy features as native CUT tokens and Monero, including RingCT. The CNT token deployment is made so user-friendly that even person without deep technical knowledge in coding or programming can deploy his / her token just by one single command. CUTcoin has its own dedicated staking pool which is managed by official project team. The Cutcoin staking pool provides an opportunity for all small stakers to earn more CUT (Daily) by staking on the official staking pool.

**My Impression**: 

A relatively new PoS coin. It had a small premine, 2%. Staking and Transactions are private. Good roadmap. Looks good overall, but not amazing. Hope it gets some traction.

*How do I feel about this project?* Good ðŸ™‚

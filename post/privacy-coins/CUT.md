**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> CUTcoin describes itself as the first CryptoNote-based pure PoS coin. Its Proof of Stake consensus conceals the total amount of coins in staking wallets. The tokens deployed on the Cutcoin chain has all privacy features as native CUT tokens and Monero, including RingCT. The CNT token deployment is made so user-friendly that even person without deep technical knowledge in coding or programming can deploy his / her token just by one single command. CUTcoin has its own dedicated staking pool which is managed by official project team. The Cutcoin staking pool provides an opportunity for all small stakers to earn more CUT (Daily) by staking on the official staking pool.

**My Impression**: 

A relatively new PoS coin. It had a small premine, 2%. Staking and Transactions are private. Good roadmap. Looks good overall, but not amazing.

*Overall impression*: OK ðŸ™‚

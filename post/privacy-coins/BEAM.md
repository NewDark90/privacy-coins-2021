**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> BEAM is a confidential decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that runs on a combination of two blockchain protocols (LelantusMW and Mimblewimble). Beam allows financial counterparties to make safe, stable and reliable transactions. This helps eliminate the problem of user data mismanagement, keeping the system cleaner and more secure. Beamâ€™s blockchain was built on the C++ programming language from scratch. User addresses are kept confidential at all times and are never disclosed to any third parties. Users have total access and control over their privacy, deciding who can access their information and what they are allowed to see. Beam supports custom transactions of different types, such as escrow, atomic swaps and time-locked ones.

**My Impression**: 

This is my favorite of the three MW coins, and one of the main reasons I wanted to dig into all of the privacy coins. While it is private by default, it has opt-in auditability. The amount of [extra features](https://beam.mw/features) that have been developed and the [roadmap](https://beam.mw/#roadmap) look very good for the future. Devs and the foundation get a 20% cut of the miner rewards for the first five years, which would seem to incentivize them to have BEAM succeed, but I can also see if that would bother some as well. There's a few things nit-picky issues that bother me with it currently, but most of which I think are being addressed or have band-aid solutions currently.

*How do I feel about this project?* Great ðŸ˜„

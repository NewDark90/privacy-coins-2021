**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> Privacy is achieved through a few distinctive features. Whereas each Bitcoin in circulation has its own serial number, meaning that cryptocurrency usage can be monitored, XMR is completely fungible. By default, details about senders, recipients and the amount of crypto being transferred are obscured — and Monero advocates says this offers an upper hand over rival privacy coins such as Zcash, which are “selectively transparent.” Obfuscation is achieved through the use of ring signatures. Here, past transaction outputs are picked from the blockchain and act as decoys, meaning that outside observers can’t tell who signed it. To ensure that transactions cannot be linked to one another, stealth addresses are created for every single transaction that are only used once.

**My Impression**: 

The Bitcoin of privacy coins. The market leader that's more of a store of value than a currency. While transaction fees are high relative to most others listed, they're still very reasonable, especially compared to BTC and ETH. Unless there's major problems that show up with the technology, it will probably stay a major/top coin. If Bitcoin's market dominance has taught me anything, even mildly flawed tech can be a juggernaut industry leader if it's the standard people build around.

*Overall impression*: Great 😁

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> Phala Network tackles the issue of trust in the computation cloud. This blockchain is a trustless computation platform that enables massive cloud processing without sacrificing data confidentiality. Built around TEE-based privacy technology already embedded into modern processors, Phala Network's distributed computing cloud is versatile and confidential. By separating the consensus mechanism from computation, Phala ensures processing power is highly scalable. Together, this creates the infrastructure for a powerful, secure, and scalable trustless computing cloud. Phala is a member parachain of the Polkadot cross-chain ecosystem.

**My Impression**: 

Seems kind of like SCRT in that it's used for private blockchain computing. Seems niche, probably useful.

*Overall impression*: Neutral üòê

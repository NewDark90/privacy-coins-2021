## *Phala Network* - PHA

**Market Cap**: ~$163 million

**Privacy**:  -  

**Transaction Stats**: ? block time **/** ? transactions per second **/** ? fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> Phala Network tackles the issue of trust in the computation cloud. This blockchain is a trustless computation platform that enables massive cloud processing without sacrificing data confidentiality. Built around TEE-based privacy technology already embedded into modern processors, Phala Network's distributed computing cloud is versatile and confidential. By separating the consensus mechanism from computation, Phala ensures processing power is highly scalable. Together, this creates the infrastructure for a powerful, secure, and scalable trustless computing cloud. As a member parachain of the Polkadot cross-chain ecosystem, Phala will be able to provide computing power to other blockchain applications while protecting the data layer, enabling possibilities like privacy-protected DeFi trading positions and transaction history, co-computing DID confidential data, developing light-node cross-chain bridges, and more.

**My Impression**: 

Seems kind of like SCRT in that it's used for private blockchain computing. Seems niche but useful.

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**:

**My Impression**: 

Another Opt-In privacy coin. This coin is the highest market cap with a zk-SNARKs implementation. Most transactions aren't z-address to z-address (private), so if the rest of the transactions are public in some capacity. Transaction stats seem passable, but not amazing. If privacy is your main concern, I'd look elsewhere. Otherwise it seems like a decent coin. Hard to say if it's undervalued given how small the sector is overall or overvalued given how good some of the other coins are.

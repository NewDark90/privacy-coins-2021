## *Verge* - XVG

**Market Cap**: ~$422 million

**Privacy**: Mixed/Optional - Wraith Protocol, I2P/Tor 

**Transaction Stats**: 30 sec block time **/** 100(2000 with RSK?) transactions per second **/** 0.1 XVG, ~0.003 USD fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> Verge was created as a way to fulfill Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of a decentralized, trustless electronic payment system while also providing more privacy than is available with Bitcoin. In order to accomplish this goal, Verge relies on a series of key privacy features. It automatically routes all traffic to and from its vergePay wallet through the Tor network, anonymizing the traffic and masking IP addresses. It also offers dual-key stealth addressing, through which senders can create one-time wallet addresses on behalf of recipients to help protect the recipients' privacy, as well as using atomic swaps to power trustless peer-to-peer cross-blockchain transactions.

**My Impression**: 

Wraith Protocol is optional, and it leaks the transaction amount unlike zk-SNARKs, oof. The chain has also been 51% attacked quite a few times, and recently had its block history re-written for a short time before a fix. That said, this coin has some pretty good transaction stats and quite a few good features like an atomic swap functionality, and smart contracts being implemented in the future through RSK. It's an interesting project that's had a shaky and strange history.

*Overall impression*: Wary ðŸ˜Ÿ

**Transaction Stats**: ? block time **/** ? transactions per second **/** ? fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> The Beldex coin (BDX) is one of the very first privacy coins to act as an in-house token. The token is cryptographically designed in such a way, that is can be easily integrated into the Beldex extended ecosystem. It distinguishes itself from other coins by providing better privacy and security. The Beldex coin improves on the features of Monero while introducing its own advancements. Beldex has a default ring size of 10, as opposed to Monero, which strengthens transaction privacy. Thus, the coin offers default privacy. Ring sizes are not immutable and are flexible as users can increase the size as per their requirement. Beldex is the world's first islamic compliant exchange.

**My Impression**: 

An "in-house" privacy coin based on an Islamic exchange website? Huh. Easily one of more niche coins in this list. The only use case I can tell is if you really want to use this exchange specifically. Monero already exists, and this is just a slightly modified Monero implementation.

*How do I feel about this project?* Wary ðŸ˜•

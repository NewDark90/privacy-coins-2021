**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> Navcoin (NAV) is an open-sourced digital currency with privacy-enhanced features. Transactions that occur on the blockchain of Navcoin are made in a peer-to-peer fashion with no need for intermediaries. Following the release of Navcoin Core 6.0, itâ€™s possible to store and transact coins both publicly (NAV) and privately (xNAV). When making a private transaction, it will not be possible to link the transaction to its sender or receiver, or even view the amount that was sent. This is made possible by Navcoinâ€™s self-developed privacy protocol called Boneh-Lynn-Shacham Confidential Transactions (blsCT). Navcoin was invented in 2014 and had no pre-mine or ICO. With block times of 30 seconds, one can stake their coins to earn rewards through Proof of Stake Version 3 (PoSv3) for helping to secure the network. Navcoinâ€™s current spendable supply is 69M NAV with a block reward of 2.5 NAV, hence a decreasing inflation model. From the 2.5 NAV, 2 NAV are redirected to the staker who found the block, and 0.5 NAV are accumulated in a decentralized treasury used to fund community initiatives based on the outcome of DAO votings. Navcoinâ€™s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) enables the community to be self-funded through its treasury, self-guided through consultations, and self-governed through consensus changes.

**My Impression**: 

At first glance, seeing this coin from back in 2014 made it look like it was 2018 bags and I was getting ready to talk shit about it. Looking into it, it's a shame this isn't higher on this list. It's got a lot of nice features. It's stakable, self governed, has regular releases, and seems overall solid. Will it break through and have a great future? Maybe, but it's got a long climb. I'm rooting for it.

*How do I feel about this project?* Good ðŸ™‚

## *PIVX* - PIVX

**Market Cap**: ~$73 million

**Privacy**: Opt-In - zk-SNARKs(transactions) 

**Transaction Stats**: 1 min block time **/** <=173 TPS Unshielded, <=60 TPS Shielded transactions per second **/** none? fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> PIVX is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that is self-funded and community-driven. It is a third-generation privacy coin and uses a modified version of Dashâ€™s masternode architecture. It also uses Zcoinâ€™s Zerocoin privacy protocol. Its transaction capacity can reach up to 1000 transactions per second through the usage of the SwiftxX payment protocol. PIVX also uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that involves two parties: the masternodes and the validators. Masternodes are responsible for voting on development proposals that are put forward by the PIVX community and validating the transactions on the blockchain with a single confirmation. 10,000 PIVX is the minimum requirement to run a masternode. Each masternode gets 1 vote and is not involved in the mining of new tokens.

**My Impression**: 

What is ZCash was proof of stake? That's PIVX in a nutshell. One of the highest PoS coins in this list. Stats are pretty great. Decentralized org. Cold Staking. Seems OK for an Opt-In Coin.

*How do I feel about this project?* Good ðŸ™‚

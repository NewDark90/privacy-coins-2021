## *Haven Protocol* - XHV

**Market Cap**: ~$193 million

**Privacy**: Full - RingCT, CryptoNote 

**Transaction Stats**: 2 min block time **/**  transactions per second **/** 0.2%-20% fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> Haven Protocol is similar to an offshore bank where users can create private tokens that represent stable and volatile assets, including commodities and fiat currencies (such as USD). The protocol is based on Monero, which focuses on secure, private and untraceable transactions. As a result, most of the features of Monero extend to the Haven protocol, including the bulletproofs and other privacy tech. The base currency of Haven is the XHV, which is burnt to provide users with private, untraceable, synthetic assets and commodities called xAssets.

**My Impression**: 

Has high fees and long transaction times. I love the inherent contradictory nature of what this one promotes versus what it explicitly says. The pitch really does say it all really. You're an "offshore bank", but the FAQ has this line: "Note: Although Haven transactions are private it should not be used for illicit or illegal purposes that violate a userâ€™s local or national laws." - lol

*Overall impression*: Wary ðŸ˜Ÿ

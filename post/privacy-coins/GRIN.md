## *Grin* - GRIN

**Market Cap**: ~$36 million

**Privacy**: Default - MimbleWimble 

**Transaction Stats**: 1 min block time **/** 25 transactions per second **/**  fee

**Coin Rundown / Pitch**: 

> Grin is a minimalistic, lightweight cryptocurrency, implementing the Mimblewimble protocol for a unique balance of privacy and scalability. The chain has no addresses, no amounts, and no need to store data of spent outputs. Grin is fully open-source and community-driven. There is no single entity behind it, Grinâ€™s development is funded by donations as well as done voluntarily by contributors. Everybody can discuss, influence, or work on its development. Grinâ€™s blocktime is 1 minute, each with a coinbase reward of 60 grins, thus creating 1 unit per second, forever. This linear emission creates a constant increase in supply, but a decreasing rate of inflation; making the emission disinflationary. This simple design serves to ensure both the long term security of the chain and a fair process of coin distribution to all participants.

**My Impression**: 

Grin is my second favorite coin of the three MimbleWimble variants. Its team is more decentralized and community driven instead of a startup like Beam. The features and roadmap are smaller than BEAM. However, this is still a great looking private currency overall.

*Overall impression*: Good ðŸ˜ƒ

## **Privacy Coins**

Before going into the details of every coin in this list. I want to make a few things known. 

*First*, I'm only going to be looking at coins, not tokens.

*Second*, there are varying degrees of how private a coin is. Some may draw the line on what "is" and "is not" a privacy coin based on different criteria. The bar that I will use for this list is going to be fairly simple and as reasonably inclusive as I can be. To be a privacy coin here, you need to at least do better than what you can do with Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, you can optionally perform a coinjoin for transactions. If your coin has Opt-In security features, it has to be better than a coinjoin. If the security feature IS a coinjoin, it must at least be the default. Having some network security bells and whistles to keep your IP private is nice, but also not enough to make the cut.

*Third*, I'm most heavily basing the opinion sections on how well I think the coin does it's job at being a private currency. Other factors are important and considered, but not the focus. 

*Fourth*, I haven't checked every coin in existence. I've found 3 lists of coins I'm working off of here, with a 4th I found later as another sanity check. [Coin Market Cap Api \(filtering by tags\)](https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/listings/latest?start=1&limit=5000&cryptocurrency_type=coins), [Cryptoslate](https://cryptoslate.com/cryptos/privacy/), [Coinlore](https://www.coinlore.com/privacy-coins), [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins)

*Fifth*, remember that this is a **very small** sector of the crypto market currently. Many of these coins are going to be far below the top 100. I've limited the criteria to be any coin over $20 million Market Cap on 3/13 (~0.002% of BTC), so the floor for these coins is very low. Why that number specifically? Mostly, I wanted to make sure Grin made the cut. Beyond that, it was trying to keep interesting projects I found near that line also in the cut. I also didn't want to add a bunch of extra work for truly bottom of the barrel coins. If you have a favorite down there that does something interesting and unique beyond being another Monero clone, I want to know. 

*Finally*, I'll also have a special list underneath these coins that specifically call out the coins that were marked as private by at least one of these lists, and reasoning as to why I think it isn't really a privacy coin.

# 2021 Guide to Private Cryptocurrency

In the past few months I've been very involved in understanding and researching cryptocurrency. Like many of you, I find the technology fascinating and the prospects for the near and distant future enthralling. However, I've noticed a few things that caused me to write this guide. 

1. Gathering the details on coins in itself usually isn't tricky on a per-coin basis. However, comparing them, especially on more technical aspects instead of market dynamics can be challenging. I want to share what I've compiled, as I was already doing half the work in an unorganized way already.
2. Privacy coins are a very, very small part of the market currently. The most generous interpretation of the current market cap of all privacy crypto coins is well under 1%. Even knowing that BTC and ETH account for ~60% and ~12% respectively, that still seems low.

Please note, some of these details will be basic, especially if you frequent /r/cryptocurrency. I want this to still be generally approachable for people relatively fresh to blockchain and crypto concepts. Some things might get over simplified, but I'll try not to throw out any important details or nuance. As always, do your own research. I'm not an expert. Please correct me with references where I'm wrong. Not financial advice.

## What is private crypto, and wait, isn't it already private? 
Well, not quite. It would be safe to say that most crypto-currencies, including bitcoin, are pseudo-anonymous. Blockchains are a distributed ledger of transactions. And because these transactions are public knowledge, you can see that wallet "ABC" gave 0.5 bitcoin to "XYZ" at a certain timeframe. You don't know that John Smith owns the "ABC" wallet. However, if anyone were to find out that John Smith owns "ABC" wallet, that makes every single transaction John Smith has ever made or recieved out of that wallet, traceable to him. 

That seems like a fundamental flaw. I don't want governments, companies, or even family combing through my entire reddit history... much MUCH less my entire financial transaction history. 

So, what's out there to solve for the privacy problem?

## **Closing Thoughts**

So, out of the top ~200 coins, or ~750 coins & tokens:

- Only 31 came up as even being labeled a privacy coin
- Only ~21 seem to actually be privacy coins 
- Only 13 *are not* opt-in.

And a handy tl;dr of my opinion on each ticker:

|Opinion|Ticker|
|:------|---------:|
|Great|XMR, BEAM, ARRR|
|Good|FIRO, PIVX, GRIN, NAV, CUT|
|Neutral|ZEC, ZEN, SCRT, PHA, OXEN, VRSC, DERO|
|Wary|XVG, XHV, MWC, BDX|
|Oof|BCN|
|Unsure|SERO|

This whole deep dive was a lot of information to dig up. I'm sure I've missed details on some of these coins.
